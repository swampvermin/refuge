                    Urban sanctuaries are spaces within urban centers which provide a respite for individuals seeking solace from the chaos of the city. Often taking the form of parks, gardens, or green spaces, urban sanctuaries give people the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and recharge. They help build community and connection to the world around us.<br><br>

                    A Brief History<br><br>
                    Washington Square Park stands as one of NYC’s most
                    renowned public parks, distinguished by its iconic Marble
                    arch and fountain. Nestled within the heart of Greenwich
                    Village on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, the park spans
                    9.75 acres, boasting a diverse array of amenities including
                    seating areas, lush green lawns, playgrounds, dog runs,
                    and paved walkways.<br>
                    Long before European settlers arrived, the land now
                    occupied by Washington Square Park was home to Native
                    Americans of the Lenape Tribe, near a village known as
                    Sapokanikan or “tobacco field.” The area featured marshy
                    grounds and was traversed by Minetta Creek, a signifi-
                    cant waterway that once flowed into the Hudson River.
                    In 1624, the Dutch West India Company established
                    a trading post in modern-day southern Manhattan. In
                    1632, the director of New Amsterdam gave land grants to
                    a group of “half-freed” slaves in exchange for a portion of
                    their crops to support the growing population at the time.
                    This led to the establishment of an early African Amer-
                    ican community known as the “Land of the Blacks” or
                    “Little Africa” surrounding the park. The children of these
                    former slaves were still born into slavery.<br>
                    In 1797, the land was reacquired by the now English
                    government in power and
                    re-purposed into a potter’s
                    field, a public burial ground,
                    where the bodies of poor
                    individuals and victims of the
                    yellow fever epidemic were
                    buried. It was rumored to also
                    be a site for public executions,
                    however, there are conflicting
                    reports about where these
                    executions took place. In
                    1825, the cemetery reached
                    capacity and was closed, with an estimated 20,000 human
                    remains still resting beneath the park’s surface to this day.
                    On July 4th, 1826, 15 years after the signing of the <br><br>

                    Declaration of Independence, the land
                    was designated as the “Washington
                    Parade Ground,” and used for local
                    militia training, before officially
                    becoming a public park in 1827. With
                    this change, affluent families moved into
                    the area and built Greek Revival-style
                    houses that still line the north side of the
                    park, known as “The Row.” This resulted
                    in a rise in the value of the surrounding
                    real estate as well as increased desirability
                    for living in the neighborhood.<br>
                    Throughout its history, Washington
                    Square Park has been the setting for
                    significant historical events. In 1834, it
                    became the site of one of New York’s first
                    organized labor riots sparked by a
                    dispute over the use of prison labor by
                    New York University, then called the
                    University of the City of New York.
                    During the construction of its first
                    university building on the east side of the
                    park, NYU contracted prison laborers to
                    complete the stone dressing of its
                    building. The city’s stone cutters were
                    infuriated by what they viewed as
                    robbery from work that would have
                    otherwise gone to them. This resulted
                    in a violent riot that spread to nearby
                    Astor Place and was only settled by the
                    deployment of the local militia. In 1838,
                    Samuel F.B. Morse demonstrated the
                    revolutionizing invention of the
                    telegraph for the first time in public
                    within the park.<br>
                    The City’s public parks department
                    was established in 1870, prompting the
                    redesign of the parade ground. M.A. Kel-
                    logg, Engineer-in-Chief, and I.A. Pilat,
                    Chief Landscape Gardener re-imagined
                    the space according to Frederick Law
                    Olmsted’s principles. This endeavor
                    involved leveling the land, landscaping
                    it, and introducing curvilinear paths and
                    shade-providing trees.<br>
                    In 1852, the first fountain was
                    installed before being promptly replaced
                    in 1872 by a fountain relocated from
                    the southern entrance of Central Park at
                    59th Street. In 1889, a large wood arch<br><br>

                    [page 7]<br><br>
                    was constructed to commemorate the
                    100th anniversary of President George
                    Washington’s inauguration. The arch
                    proved to be a major success and
                    architect Stanford White was
                    commissioned to create a permanent
                    arch made of marble, inspired by Paris’
                    Arc de Triomphe. The iconic Washington
                    Square Arch was constructed between
                    the years 1890 and 1892, and it now
                    stands at an impressive 77 feet tall.<br>
                    Throughout the 20th century,
                    Washington Square Park emerged as a
                    vibrant hub of social and cultural
                    activity, drawing artists like street
                    performers, musicians, and writers,
                    among whom were notable figures such
                    as Mark Twain and Allen Ginsberg.
                    However, tragedy struck the park on
                    March 25th, 1911, with the devastating
                    fire at the nearby Triangle Shirtwaist
                    Factory, claiming the lives of 146 young
                    working-class immigrant women.<br>
                    In 1935, Robert Moses, one of New
                    York City’s most influential and
                    controversial urban planners, proposed a
                    renovation plan that would have
                    obliterated the existing landscape by
                    constructing a highway directly through
                    the square, connecting Fifth Avenue
                    to lower Manhattan. However, fierce
                    neighborhood opposition resulted in
                    a community victory, preventing the
                    construction of the highway. During
                    the 20th century, the park also became a
                    focal point for civil rights protests,
                    anti-war protests, and movements for
                    social justice. Activists gathered in the
                    park to rally, march, and organize, using
                    its central location and symbolic
                    significance to amplify their messages.<br>
                    In 1964, driven by the advocacy of
                    Greenwich Village residents, the park
                    underwent a redesign, closing off traffic
                    that previously flowed directly through
                    the arch via Fifth Avenue.<br>
                    Since then, Washington Square Park
                    has undergone further enhancements,
                    including the addition of playgrounds,
                    chess tables, and performance plazas.
                    Another multi-phase renovation project
                    launched in 2009, aimed at improving
                    accessibility, amenities, and overall aes-
                    thetics, ensuring its continued role as a
                    vibrant social hub in New York City.<br><br>

                    The city council reacquired the land and established it as a potter’s field. By the time it became filled and closed in 1825, over 20,000 human remains had been buried there.<br><br>
                    1826 <br>
                    On July 4th, the former potter’s field was renamed the Washington Parade Ground for local militia training.<br><br>

                    One of NYC’s first organized labor riots occurs as a result of NYU’s use of prison labor for the construction of its new building on the east side of the park, which was met with fierce resistance by the Stone Cutter’s Guild. The 27th New York regiment was deployed and camped in Washington Square for four days and nights until peace was restored.<br><br>

                    The marble Washington Square Arch is designed by Stanford White.<br><br>
                    1911<br>
                    On March 25th near the park, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire occurred, one of the deadliest industrial disasters in U.S. history. 146 garment workers are killed, the youngest victim was 14 years old.<br><br>
                    1964<br>
                    Traffic is closed off and Fifth avenue no longer runs through the Washington Square Arch as a result of vigilant community advocates.<br><br>

                    Modern Day<br><br>
                    In Washington Square Park, a dynamic mix of locals and tourists create an ever-changing scene. From artisan crafts, clothing, books, art, drugs, or impromptu poetry, independent street vendors offer an eclectic array of goods. Skateboarders glide through paved walkways and in the colder months fill the main fountain’s bowl. Visitors often lounge in the sun, surrounded by street performers, artists, NYU students, and families enjoying leisurely moments together. Children play, friends gather, and music fills the air, evoking a friendly atmosphere and positive energy throughout the park.<br><br>

                    The true mark of seasons changing and spring time commencing in Washginton Square Park is the installation of hundreds of tulips throughout it’s grounds.<br>
                    Every year the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation plant approximately 110,000 tulips.<br><br>
