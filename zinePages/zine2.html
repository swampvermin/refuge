                    Urban sanctuaries are spaces within urban centers which provide a respite for individuals seeking solace from the chaos of the city. Often taking the form of parks, gardens, or green spaces, urban sanctuaries give people the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and recharge. They help build community and connection to the world around us.<br><br>

                    Collect Pond Park<br>
                    130 Leonard St,<br>
                    New York, NY 10013<br><br>

                    A Brief History<br><br>
                    Located within the vibrant Chinatown neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, Collect Pond Park stands as a restament to New York City's rich history and resilience. Situated just a few blocks south of Canal Street, between Centre and Lafayette Street, the park is surrounded by a diverse set of landmarks, including
                    courthouses, a jail, restaurants, a homeless shelter, and a n NYU dormitory, offering a
                    tranquil haven amidst the bustling city.<br>
                    Centuries ago, the site was home to Collect Pond, a large freshwater body covering
                    about 48 acres and reaching depths of 60 feet. Located in Lower Manhattan, it was
                    fed by a deep underground spring and surrounded by hills. The pond served as the
                    main water supply for lower Manhattan during the first two centuries of European
                    settlement, draining into the Hudson River. Originally, the banks of Collect Pond
                    were occupied by the Native American settlement presumed to be named
                    "Werpoes." The pond underwent a series of renamings, from "Kolch" by Dutch
                    settlers to "the Collect" under English rule. During the early 17th century, when
                    New York was still a small town in southern Manhattan, Collect Pond was a popular
                    recreational space. Locals often fished there in warmer months and enjoyed ice
                    skating in the winter.<br>
                    By the mid-1800s, Collect Pond was buried, paving the way for the rise of the
                    famous Five Points neighborhood, where middle-class families soon erected homes
                    atop the former pond's location. Despite these efforts, poor engineering and an
                    underground spring that continued to feed water to the site led to the area
                    becoming a mud pit that emitted horrible odors and was infested with mosquitoes.
                    The affluent residents of the neighborhood eventually fled the area, leaving the
                    neighborhood to those living in poverty and newly arrived immigrants who flooded
                    America during the early 1820s. The Five Points neighborhood was transformed into
                    one of the United State's first slums.<br>
                    Comprising modern-day streets such as Mulberry Street, Mosco Street, Baxter
                    Street, and the now-vanished Little Water Street, Five Points was plagued by<br><br>

                    [page 5]<br><br>

                    rampant crime, unemployment, disease, gangs, prostitution rings, and high murder rates. To address the area's lawlessness, "The Tombs," a jailhouse, was erected in 1838. The plight of lower-class immigrant families persisted until the publication of Jacob Riis's exposé, "How the Other Half Lives," which catalyzed reform efforts. The publication brought awareness to the dire conditions prevalent in the area, prompting efforts for urban renewal. Within four years, the city condemned all the tenements in the area, transforming the space into a civic center. In 1941, the former jailhouse was replaced by the Manhattan Detention Complex, still known as the Tombs, bordering the park's eastern side. Today, the park is encircled by a criminal court, civil court, and family court, all still visible from the parkland. <br>  
                    By 1960, the site of present-day Collect Pond Park fell under park jurisdiction, initially named Civil Court Park due to its proximity to judicial buildings. However, in homage to its original identity, Commissioner Henry J. Stern renamed it "Collect Pond Park." Today, the park spans just under an acre, offering a tranquil respite amidst Lower Manhattan's hustle and bustle. Remnants of its past include a man-made pond, filled in warmer months and drained in winter, amidst paved pathways, trees, and an ample amount of seating. Collect Pond Park in Lower Manhattan stands as a testament to the city's endurance and transformation.

                    AS IT STANDS TODAY, IT'S HARD TO imagine that a large pond once occupied the heart of Lower Manhattan amidst its industrial and urban landscape. Nowadays, the park mainly attracts locals seeking a momentary respite, whether it be a quick pause for lunch, a place to take their break from work, or simply a spot to rest their feet from walking around the city.

                    COLLECT POND PARK SITS IN A UNIQUE SPOT where people who live in completely different worlds intersect. On the eastern side, you have a jailhouse located right next to Chinese eateries. To the south you have corporate workers heading to office and the federal courthouses, often the location of protests. To the west there are homeless shelters, which is probably why come sundown, Collect Pond is locked to prevent people from coming in. In contrast, only a couple hundred feet away is the start of the Tribeca neighborhood, with spacious lofts and high rent prices which highlight the area's diversity.
