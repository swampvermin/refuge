                    Urban sanctuaries are spaces within urban centers which provide a respite for individuals seeking solace from the chaos of the city. Often taking the form of parks, gardens, or green spaces, urban sanctuaries give people the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and recharge. They help build community and connection to the world around us.<br><br>

                    A Brief History<br><br>
                    The Brooklyn Heights Promenade, also referred to as the Esplanade,
                    is a pedestrian walkway and platform spanning 1,826 feet long, resting
                    above the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway within the Brooklyn Heights
                    neighborhood. It stretches from Remsen Street to Orange Street and
                    offers unrivaled views of the lower Manhattan skyline and iconic
                    landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and One World
                    Trade Center. The area was originally a Native American settlement
                    presumably called "Ihpetonga." Brooklyn Heights was initially settled
                    by Europeans in 1645 and has since evolved into one of New York
                    City's most desirable neighborhoods, conveniently located just a short
                    subway ride from Manhattan. The neighborhood has a family-friendly
                    and serene charm, boasting luxurious brownstone townhouses which
                    in 2023 had a median cost of $1.19 million. During the Dutch
                    colonial period in NYC, settlements were primarily concentrated<br><br>

                    [page 5]<br><br>
                    along Brooklyn's waterfront and bustling with ferry activities.<br>
                    Following this period in the mid-1800s, the area where the Brooklyn
                    Heights Promenade would be located was filled with mostly private
                    gardens where locals frequently "promenaded." The original idea for
                    the Promenade was first foreshadowed by a prominent landowner of
                    Brooklyn Heights, Hezekiah Beers Pierrepont (1768-1838), During
                    his time he proposed the idea of a walkway with gardens that allowed
                    the residents of Brooklyn Heights to take in the amazing views of
                    Manhattan. However, his ideas were not taken seriously.<br>
                    It wasn't until 1941 when Robert Moses, a renowned urban planner
                    and influential figure in New York City, introduced a proposal for a
                    highway that could connect the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs. Ini-
                    tially, Moses's plan involved cutting right through Brooklyn Heights,
                    threatening the destruction of numerous historic structures.<br>
                    Understandably, the local community was extremely opposed to these
                    notions and fiercely lobbied for an alternative route. Community
                    opposition compelled a reevaluation of plans, ultimately preserving
                    the neighborhood's architectural heritage. The alternative proposal put
                    forth and eventually passed shifted the highway so that it would run
                    along the neighborhood's edge.

                <p data-page-transcript="4" style="display: none;">
                    [page 6]<br><br>
                    Construction on the highway commenced in 1946 and was conclud-
                    ed in 1954. However, the southern section of the Brooklyn
                    Promenade opened to the public on October 7th, 1950, followed by
                    the northern section on December 7th, 1951.<br>
                    Fast forward to the present, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade faces
                    a different kind of challenge - structural wear from relentless traffic.
                    Proposed solutions include a six-year closure of the Promenade for a
                    six-lane highway, estimated to cost $3.6 billion dollars The alternative
                    is an eight-year repair plan for the highway which would see the Prom-
                    enade closed for around 2 years and would total $4 billion dollars. As
                    discussions unfold, the community remains engaged in shaping the
                    future of this iconic landmark. It's unclear what the plans for repairing
                    the Brooklyn Promenade are but options are still being considered. <br>
                    This story of the Brooklyn Heights Promenade stands as a testament
                    to community activism and unity prevailing against the destruction
                    of a neighborhood's history and culture by government officials who
                    disregard local heritage and sentiments.

                    MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE I LIVED ON CLARK ST
                    at NYU's dorm in Brooklyn Heights. I was a broke college kid living
                    in a shared studio with a roommate, surrounded by fancy brownstone
                    townhouses probably owned by millionaires. The juxtaposition made
                    me laugh. I was entranced by NYC and how surreal it felt to live there,
                    after only knowing my small hometown in the middle of Florida.
                    Every night, I went to the Brooklyn Promenade and sat on one of the
                    benches surrounding a globe sculpture there. It was around a seven
                    minute walk from my dorm. It became a nightly ritual. During the
                    day, the Brooklyn Promenade is usually busy. I would see a lot of
                    tourists, families taking a stroll, people going on runs, or dog walkers.
                    But at night, I was lucky to see more than five people the whole night.
                    Sometimes I saw no one. I had the whole space to myself. Thousands
                    of people probably live in Brooklyn Heights, but not many had the
                    same idea as me. I still remember the dark navy blue sky contrasted
                    against the white city lights. I felt blessed every night to have a view as
                    beautiful as that.

                    An armillary sundial is a
                    type of sundial consisting
                    of a spherical framework
                    with rings representing the
                    celestial equator, ecliptic,
                    and other celestial circles.
                    It's used to tell time based
                    on the position of the
                    sun's shadow.<br>
